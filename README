What is Yeast?
--------------
Every other web framework has a really simple way to create a new project.
With Cake, it's "download this zip, unzip it, put this file here, change this value, etc..."

*This sucks, big time.*

Yeast is an attempt to fix this. It's a little bash script to manage your versions
of CakePHP and create projects easily.



Installation
------------
Get the "yeast" (if using Unix) or "yeast.bat" (if using Windows) file, drop it in your path somewhere and make it executable.



Usage (Unix)
------------
Install CakePHP 1.3 (cake code stored in /usr/lib/cakephp/ by default)
    sudo yeast install 1.3
	Download from http://cakephp.org

Uninstall CakePHP 1.3
    sudo yeast uninstall 1.3

Show installed versions
    yeast list

Create a new project
    yeast create <project_path>


	
Usage (Windows)
---------------
( Thanks to abailiss (https://github.com/abailiss) for the Windows port (https://github.com/abailiss/Yeast) )

NOTE: Install CakePHP before running yeast (cake code referenced from C:\wamp\www\cakephp\ by default)

Open CMD and run the following command:
	yeast create [install_path] <library_path>

If you need further usage instructions just run yeast with no parameters.



For those who require factual correctness (Unix only)
-----------------------------------------------------
It has come to my attention that yeast is not a primary ingredient in cake ( See https://github.com/whilefalse/Yeast/pull/1 and https://github.com/whilefalse/Yeast/pull/2 )

To fix this bug, please run:
    ./factual_correctness_patch <cake_ingredient>

to generate a new cake making tool with a more appropriate name.
